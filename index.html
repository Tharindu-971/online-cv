                <p>In descriptive writing, the author does not just tell the 
                    reader what was seen, felt, tested, smelled, or heard. 
                    Rather, the author describes something from their own 
                    experience and, through careful choice of words and phrasing,
                    makes it seem real. Descriptive writing is vivid, colorful, and detailed.

                    American English grammar is difficult, confusing and, at best, 
                    hard to learn. Learning to use correct grammar requires a lot of 
                    skills including research, persistence and a willingness to keep 
                    going until you conquer more of the grammar skills.
                    Interestingly, you can learn many of these skills from the actions of your pet. 
                    Of course, you still have to learn the grammar rules; but, 
                    your pet can help you understand the approach you need to take to 
                    becoming an expert grammarian
